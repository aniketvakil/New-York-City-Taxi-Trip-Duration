Kaggle competition to predict the duration of a taxi trip in New York City

This is a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration) aimed at creating a model to predict the total duration of a taxi trip in New York City, USA. Dataset is provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

After pre-processing the data and plotting some graphs to capture the relationships between various attributes and target attribute, I have used 2 approaches to predict the duration: Random Forrest Regressor and Neural Networks.

Both NBs have been provided in this repository.
